Rules for coupling ISSM and MITgcm:

>>>> LEGEND FOR coupling_rules.jpg

Initialization:
0. Pass M0 = Ii->m(H0) to MITgcm

All Steps:
1. Run ISSM no melt
   Results in H1d, new thickness from
   H1d = H0 + Dt (dH/dt) (dynamic part only)
2. Pass M1D = Ii->m(H1d) to MITgcm
3. Compute dynamic ice mass change only on MITgcm side, i.e.,
   not including melt rate: Phi = (M1d - M0) / Dt
   Note that by computing on the MITgcm side, this will include a
   correction for any possible deviation between ISSM and MITgcm thickness.
   Run MITgcm with this dynamic thinning + correction.
   Results in M1, a new ice thickness calculated by the ocean model.
4. Pass Melt1 rate to ISSM.
5. Run ISSM with melt rate: melt = Im->i(Melt1).
   Results in H1, a new ice thickness calculated by ISSM.
